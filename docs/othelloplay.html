			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Roderigo and Iago.  </h2>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">O never tell me! I take it much unkindly  </p>
			<p class="verseline">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As if the strings were thine, shou1dst know of this.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Sblood, but you will not hear me.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If ever I did dream of such a matter,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Abhor me.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou told’st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Off-capp’d to him; and, by the faith of man,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, in conclusion,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nonsuits my mediators; for, “Certes,” says he,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">“I have already chose my officer.”  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And what was he?  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine  </p>
			<p class="verseline">(A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife)  </p>
			<p class="verseline">That never set a squadron in the field,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor the division of a battle knows  </p>
			<p class="verseline">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Wherein the toged consuls can propose  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof  </p>
			<p class="verseline">At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d  </p>
			<p class="verseline">By debator and creditor. This counter-caster,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And I -God bless the mark!- his Moorship’s ancient.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, there’s no remedy. ‘Tis the curse of service,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Preferment goes by letter and affection,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And not by old gradation, where each second  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whether I in any just term am affined  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To love the Moor.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not follow him then.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, sir, content you.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:  </p>
			<p class="verseline">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">That doting on his own obsequious bondage  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And throwing but shows of service on their lords  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And such a one do I profess myself.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">For, sir,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">In following him, I follow but myself;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But seeming so, for my peculiar end.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">For when my outward action doth demonstrate  </p>
			<p class="verseline">The native act and figure of my heart  </p>
			<p class="verseline">In complement extern, ‘tis not long after  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve  </p>
			<p class="verseline">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If he can carry’t thus!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Call up her father,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As it may lose some color.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Here is her father’s house; I’ll call a loud.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As when, by night and negligence, the fire  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is spied in populous cities.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="verseline">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!  </p>

			<p class="prose">Virtue? a fig! ‘Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.  </p>
			<p class="prose">Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions.  </p>
			<p class="prose">But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect or scion.  </p>

I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration-put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle  </p>
			<p class="prose">Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoyher- therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.  </p>
			<p class="character">Roderigo  </p>
			<p class="prose">Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="prose">Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyselfa pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.  </p>

And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties- all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself-a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.  </p>

I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you.

Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.

			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I think so too.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Men should be what they seem;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or those that be not, would they might seem none!  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Certain, men should be what they seem.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, yet there’s more in this.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts  </p>
			<p class="verseline">The worst of words.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good my lord, pardon me;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Though I am bound to every act of duty,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As where’s that palace whereinto foul things  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But some uncleanly apprehensions  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit  </p>
			<p class="verseline">With meditations lawful?  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If thou but think’st him wrong’d and makest his ear  </p>
			<p class="verseline">A stranger to thy thoughts.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do beseech you-  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">From one that so imperfectly conceits,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Out of his scattering and unsure observance.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">It mere not for your quiet nor your good,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To let you know my thoughts.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">What dost thou mean?  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is the immediate jewel of their souls.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who steals my purse steals trash; ‘tis something, nothing;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twas mine, ‘tis his, and has been slave to thousands;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But he that filches from me my good name  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Robs me of that which not enriches him  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And makes me poor indeed.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor shall not, whilst ‘tis in my custody.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ha!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!  </p>
			<p class="verseline">It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock  </p>
			<p class="verseline">The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">O misery!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But riches fineless is as poor as winter  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To him that ever fears he shall be poor.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend  </p>
			<p class="verseline">From jealousy!  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, why is this?  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Think’st thou lid make a life of jealousy,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To follow still the changes of the moon  </p>
			<p class="verseline">With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat  </p>
			<p class="verseline">When I shall turn the business of my soul  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Matching thy inference. ‘Tis not to make me jealous  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw  </p>
			<p class="verseline">The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And on the proof, there is no more but this-  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Away at once with love or jealousy!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To show the love and duty that I bear you  </p>
			<p class="verseline">With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not have your free and noble nature  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to’t.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I know our country disposition well;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks  </p>
			<p class="verseline">They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Dost thou say so?  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">She did deceive her father, marrying you;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">She loved them most.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And so she did.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, go to then.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">She that so young could give out such a seeming,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak-  </p>
			<p class="verseline">He thought ‘twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I humbly do beseech you of your pardon  </p>
			<p class="verseline">For too much loving you.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am bound to thee forever.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not a jot, not a jot.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I’faith, I fear it has.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I hope you will consider what is spoke  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am to pray you not to strain my speech  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To grosser issues nor to larger reach  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than to suspicion.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I will not.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Should you do so, my lord,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">My speech should fall into such vile success  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend-  </p>
			<p class="verseline">My lord, I see you’re moved.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">No, not much moved.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.  </p>

			<p class="verseline">Long live she so! and long live you to think so!  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And yet, how nature erring from itself-  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, there’s the point, as- to be bold with you-  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not to affect many proposed matches  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whereto we see in all things nature tends-  </p>

			<p class="verseline">Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But pardon me. I do not in position  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">May fall to match you with her country forms,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And happily repent.  </p>

			<p class="verseline">I’ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do repent me that I put it to you.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">You would be satisfied?  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Would? Nay, I will.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Behold her topp’d?  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Death and damnation! O!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">It were a tedious difficulty, I think,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster  </p>
			<p class="verseline">More than their own! What then? how then?  </p>
			<p class="verseline">What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?  </p>
			<p class="verseline">It is impossible you should see this  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If imputation and strong circumstances,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which lead directly to the door of truth,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Will give you satisfaction, you may have’t.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do not like the office;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But sith I am enter’d in this cause so far,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Prick’d to’t by foolish honesty and love,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, being troubled with a raging tooth,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I could not sleep.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">There are a kind of men so loose of soul,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">One of this kind is Cassio.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">In sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let us be wary, let us hide our loves”;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cry, “O sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Over my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d; and then  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cried, “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">O monstrous! monstrous!  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, this was but his dream.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">But this denoted a foregone conclusion.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">And this may help to thicken other proofs  </p>
			<p class="verseline">That do demonstrate thinly.  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll tear her all to pieces.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">She may be honest yet. Tell me but this;  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?  </p>
			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I gave her such a one; ‘twas my first gift.  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I know not that; but such a handkerchief-  </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am sure it was your wife’s- did I today  </p>

			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be that-  </p>
			<p class="character">Iago  </p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be that, or any that was hers,  </p>

			<p class="verseline">O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!  </p>
			<p class="verseline">One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Now do I see ‘tis true. Look here, Iago,  </p>
			<p class="verseline">All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis gone.  </p>
			<p class="verseline">Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!  </p>

			<p class="character">Othello  </p>
			<p class="verseline">This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;  </p>

			<p class="verseline">Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye  </p>

If you will watch his going thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him.
