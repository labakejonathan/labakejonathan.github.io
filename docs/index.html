Inflamed with passion and jealousy an enraged he kills Desdemona.</p>

<p>Iago’s wife Emilia informs Othello of Desdemona’s innocence revealing Iago’s dastardly plot but she to is killed by Iago. He is filled with remorse and in revenge tries to kill Iago but only wounds him. Before he can be arrested he commits suicide.</p>
